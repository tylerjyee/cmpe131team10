### Title: Email and Chat Website

### Ethical Implications
Building an email and chat website contains sensitive information that each user enters when interacting with our system. Information from username and password to the contents of emails and chat messages. All of this information is kept in our internal database and it is not to be shared with any other sources. By keeping our system internal, it allows us to control who has access to this type of data. With other applications such as Gmail or Outlook, our application includes everything in one. This makes it convenient and more secure since only users who have an account with our site can access it.

### Implementation
Communication is a big part of our world today since we normally work with other people. Our website allows a user to send and recieve emails within an internal system to other users. In order for a user to use our website, they would need to make an account and it would then give them access to our website. Besides sending snd recieving emails, the user is able to send chat messages and create a todo list.
